# ML-Diabetics-Prediction-
ML Diabetes Prediction – A machine learning project using SVM to predict whether a person is diabetic or non-diabetic based on features like glucose, BMI, blood pressure, insulin, and age. Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization for early detection.
ML Diabetes Prediction – Project Overview

Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection is critical to prevent serious complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, and nerve damage. This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether an individual is diabetic or non-diabetic based on clinical and lifestyle-related features.

The model uses the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, which is highly effective for binary classification problems. SVM works by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates the classes (diabetic vs non-diabetic) in the feature space. It can handle both linear and non-linear relationships through kernel functions, making it suitable for medical datasets where features may interact in complex ways.

Dataset Information

This project typically uses the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which contains features such as:

Number of pregnancies

Glucose level

Blood pressure

Skin thickness

Insulin level

Body Mass Index (BMI)

Diabetes Pedigree Function (genetic risk factor)

Age

Outcome (0 = Non-diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)


These features are used to train the model to accurately classify new patients.

Project Workflow

The workflow of this project includes:

1. Data Loading and Exploration – Understanding dataset structure and feature distributions.


2. Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, scaling features, and preparing data for the SVM model.


3. Splitting Data – Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate performance.


4. Model Training – Building and tuning the SVM model.


5. Evaluation – Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure performance.


6. Prediction and Visualization – Making predictions for new cases and visualizing important features.



Outcome and Benefits

The final model predicts whether an individual is diabetic or non-diabetic. Early detection allows for timely intervention, lifestyle adjustments, and preventive care, reducing long-term health risks. This project is ideal  in machine learning and for healthcare applications, demonstrating the practical use of SVM in medical diagnostics.
